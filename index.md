This project is an inexpensive fully custom designed 3D printer. The design utilizes common off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts in its construction. This printer is designed to be something that can become a lesson plan, where the design can be broken down into very simplified concepts so that lessons plans can be developed around small steps that accumulate into the realization of a completely working 3D printer.

You, yes, you. If you've received a direct invitation to view this project from me, it means you are my friend who I would like to help build this 3D printer. Here's the deal only available to you:

 * You will read everything here, read absolutely everything I write, there will be many many many lessons
 * There are homework exercises for you to complete, and I will check your work and give you feedback
 * You will build this 3D printer!
 * You will buy the parts
 * I will double check you are buying the right parts
 * I will 3D print the parts you need 3D printed
 * I will give you spare parts whenever I can
 * I will meet up with you if you need help, I can bring tools
 * When you are done, I will make absolutely sure what you have built is safe
 * You will take pictures so I can post it to this website

What's in it for me? You are my test subject. I don't actually need this printer right now, but I do want to see that my design works! The 3D printing marketplace is constantly evolving and I want to keep up with some new developments. This new design uses the more common 1.75mm filament and all FIVE of 3D printers that I use needs 2.85mm filament, meaning even if I build it, I can't use it myself. But I have that need to prove to myself that I can design good 3D printer that doesn't use expensive parts and techniques.

You are my friend, so I bet you already know it'll be good.

General Design Overview
=======================

It's basically a copy of my Hephaestus https://eleccelerator.com/hephaestus-my-own-3d-printer/ . But this time, key differences:

 * uses 1.75mm filament, instead of 2.85mm
 * single Z leadscrew, instead of two
 * uses a stock Hemera extruder, instead of a flexible-shaft driven Titan Aero
 * uses limit switches, instead of sensorless homing
 * fully metric, instead of a mix of metric and imperial
 * uses 2020 for the frame, instead of 1010
 * no water-jet cut parts
 * all motion components now available from Amazon, instead of industrial supplies

In general, this still means:

 * Ultimaker-like mechanics
 * 24V electrical system
 * No bed sensor required
 * About 200mm x 200mm build size
 * 32-bit microcontroller (8-bit is still an option)

CAD
===

The whole 3D printer was 3D modeled first, almost every single part, using Onshape. This means:

 * I can share the design with you, and you can modify it under your own Onshape account
 * I can give you CAD homework, and I can check if you did it right, AND I can even check if you cheated, because I can check the file history
 * You can design your own custom parts and share it with me, so I can give you feedback
 * You don't even need a computer. Onshape runs in the cloud and accessible through any web browser or their smartphone app
